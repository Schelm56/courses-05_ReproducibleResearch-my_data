Impact of severe weather events on public health and economic results


Synopsis

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern. This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

This data analysis addresses the following questions:
1.Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health.
2.Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences.


Key Take away

Main results of the study: 1. Tornado is the most hazardous climate event with more than 5600 deaths and 91400 injuries. 2. Floods have caused the most significant economic damage - more than 130 billion USD. This is followed by hurricanes/typhoons and tornados.
